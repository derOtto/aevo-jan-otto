# LaTex Beamer Presentation with Handouts Template

Create your content once, compile it to Beamer and to handouts. 

## Why such a thing? There is a already handout option!?

Yes, there is a handout option. But sometimes you may want to create a handout, which has the structure of a book, report or article instead of slides. 
You may also want to add existing explanatory details, which may have been omitted in the presentation slides.
This is, when you want to compile your slide's content towards another LaTex class (book, report, arcticle). To make this easiert, I created this template.

## Concept 

Basically, you split your presentation into paarts, part1.tex to partn.tex and put them in the config folder.

Then you compile them towards the both main files and voila - you get your presentation and your handouts. Write once, compile to both. 

Note: You should target on formatting your pages for the beamer presentation layout. Nobody cares, if the content is split over pages in your handouts. But on your presentation you want everything to look nice.

Tweak with the config files to customize for your own needs.
